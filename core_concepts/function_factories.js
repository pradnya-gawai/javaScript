/* Why Function Factories are Useful:

Code Reusability:
Instead of writing multiple similar functions, you can write one factory function that generates all the variations.
For example, instead of manually creating functions to double or triple a number, you use makeMultiplier to generate those functions dynamically.

Customization:
Function factories allow you to create highly customized functions on the fly based on specific needs.
You can generate as many variations of a function as needed, with different preset arguments.

Simplifies Complex Logic:
Complex logic can be encapsulated within the factory function, leaving the generated functions simple and easy to use.

Maintains Clean Code:
By using closures, you avoid global variables and keep your code modular and clean.
The factory function and its closures handle the complexity, making the resulting functions easy to use. */
