Core JavaScript Concepts:

1 Closures:
Understanding how closures work and where they are useful.
Practice creating functions that use closures.

2 Asynchronous JavaScript:
Promises: Creating, chaining, and handling errors.
async/await: How it works and converting promise chains to async/await.
Event Loop: How JavaScript handles asynchronous operations.

3 Scope and Hoisting:
Function scope vs. block scope (var, let, const).
Hoisting behavior of variables and functions.

4 Prototypes and Inheritance:
Prototype chain and how JavaScript handles inheritance.
Difference between prototypal inheritance and classical inheritance.

5 Event Delegation:
How event delegation works and why it is used.
Practical examples in DOM manipulation.

6 JavaScript Design Patterns:
Singleton, Module, Observer, Factory patterns.
Practical implementations of these patterns in your projects.

7 Higher-Order Functions:
Functions that return other functions or take functions as arguments (map, reduce, filter).
Examples of using higher-order functions in array manipulation.

8 Error Handling:
Best practices for handling errors using try...catch and custom error handling.
Creating and throwing custom errors.

Advanced Concepts:

1 Currying and Partial Application:
Understanding and using function currying and partial application in practical scenarios.

2 Event Loop and Concurrency Model:
In-depth understanding of the event loop, call stack, task queue, and microtasks.
How JavaScript handles concurrency.

3 JavaScript Engine Internals:
How JavaScript engines (like V8) execute code, optimize performance, and manage memory.

4 Debouncing and Throttling:
Implementing debounce and throttle functions to optimize performance.

5 Modules and Module Bundlers:
Understanding ES6 modules, import/export, and how module bundlers like Webpack work.
